Example: 
Consider a version : 1.8.0, In this:

1 : Major Version (Changes only when something becomes mandatory or breaks previous versions)
8 : Minor Version (Added some new features)
0 : Patch version (Some bug fix done)

TO INSTALL LATEST VERSION OF A PACKAGE:

npm i underscore@latest 
OR 
npm i underscore@1.8.x
OR
npm i underscore@1.8

MEANING of ~ and ^ :

1) ^
Example:
  underscore: "^4.17.4"

This means npm will install the latest version of the software if available

2) ~
Example:
  underscore: "~4.17.5"

Latest version available is in 4 is : 4.17.9
Most lastest is 6.

This means we want the latest version of the patch release.
In this case 4.17.9 will be used

3)We want to use a specific version no matter what:
  underscore: "4.17.4"

4)to get the latest version use * or X 
  underscore: "*"
  OR
  underscore: "X"
