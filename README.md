# npm
This is a demo project of npm.

It is used as a dummy to create a npm package with the name npm-proj-dash.(Search on npmjs.com)

Also the tags can be found which are for understanding how the versioning of the packages are done.

I will be updating this project with all the commands of npm which are used as bread and butter by any dev.
